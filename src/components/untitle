-I have research and get the knowledge of
->Library
-face-api.js using reactjs ->no backend and runs on browser

->Third party library for face recognition
->CompreFace
-Support everything with all frontend
-Recommand-> Docker
-run as a local or cloud server

->Human.js
-Runs on browser & no backend
-Uses WebGL/WebGPU/WASM for speed

Webcam/Image → Human.js → Face Detection → Face Embeddings
↓
Compare with Known Faces
↓
Recognized / Unknown
↓
Draw on Canvas (bounding boxes + name)
↓
Repeat (requestAnimationFrame for real-time)

Start Webcam
↓
Capture Video Frame
↓
Human.js detect(frame)
↓
Get face boxes + embeddings
↓
Compare embeddings with knownFaces
↓
Assign name (recognized/unknown)
↓
Draw bounding box + name on canvas
↓
Repeat (requestAnimationFrame for real-time)
↓
[Optional] Add face → store embedding in knownFaces



- login or face lock -> if user authenticated -> goes on next page
            or else shows face detect
